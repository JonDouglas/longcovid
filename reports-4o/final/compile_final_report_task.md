## Findings

### Long COVID Mechanisms
- **Immune Dysregulation:** Persistent activation of the immune system, with elevated cytokines such as IL-6.
- **Viral Persistence:** Ongoing presence of viral components, stimulating immune responses.
- **Mitochondrial Dysfunction:** Impaired energy production, contributing to fatigue.
- **Autoimmune Phenomena:** Development of autoantibodies targeting the host's tissues.
- **Recent Research:** Highlights the role of viral persistence and immune dysregulation [ScienceDirect, 2023; MDPI, 2023].

### Epidemiology of Long COVID
- **Prevalence and Risk Factors:** Affects approximately 10-30% of COVID-19 survivors. Risk factors include severe initial infection and female gender.
- **Geographical Variations:** Reports indicate higher prevalence in regions with high COVID-19 case numbers.
- **Latest Trends:** Increasing recognition of Long COVID in pediatric populations.

### Immune Responses and Dysfunction
- **Immune Abnormalities:** Evidence of T cell exhaustion and altered NK cell function.
